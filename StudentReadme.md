### Evaluate a news article with Natural Language Processing

This project I build a web tool that allows users to run 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or
blogs found on other websites.

Using an exciting new api called `Aylien`, we can build a simple web interface to interact with their NLP system. 
This tool will give us back pertinent information about the article, 
like whether the content is subjective (opinion) 
or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone.

We used as server `Express` and frond end development tool `Webpack` 

## How to run the project

- Clone the repo and in the root folder in your terminal run npm install.
    
    This will install all the dependencies and development tools required by the project in the target file . They are all 
    present in the `pakage.json` file.
    
- Then run the `npm run build-prod` command this will generate the dist folder and cache folders too.
